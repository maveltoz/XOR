* Multilayer Perceptron

A limitation of single-layer perceptron architecture is that it is only capable of separating data points with a single line. This is unfortunate because the XOR problem's inputs are not linearly separable.

The solution to this problem is to expand beyond the single-layer architecture by adding an additional layer of units without any direct access to the outside world, known as a hidden layer. This kind of architecture is another feed-forward network known as a multilayer perceptron (MLP).

So, we use multi-layer perceptron as of the following architecture.
